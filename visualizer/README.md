# USB Gamepad Visualizer

This simple application will let you test a USB gamepad that is under
development by allowing you to see which buttons and joysticks are
being pressed.
It has been tested with an off-the-shelf, Logitech F310 gamepad
configured in Direct input mode (switch flipped to 'D' on the back).
